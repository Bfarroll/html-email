<h2 class="headingTwo">What is an auto-enrolment pension scheme?</h2>
        
<p class="paragraph1">It is a pension scheme which your staff are automatically enrolled into by you, their employer. You and your staff must contribute into the pension scheme. They can opt out if they wish but you cannot do so.</p>

    <h2>How we will help you.</h2>
        
<p class="paragraph2">All we need is some basic information from you so that we can calculate how much it will cost you over the next three years and also which staff are exempt.</p>
        
    <h3>How do we compare?</h3>

    <p class="paragraph3">Our comparison guide shows that no other provider has all bases covered like we do. Whether it is a visit to see the staff, to discounts for your staff off the local shopping bill, to a superior investment management proposition, we offer the most comprehensive service.

We hold insurance if we ever get it wrong and the pension fund is ring-fenced under trust. If you are able to get the same all inclusive package elsewhere, with the same comprehensive insurance package, we will refund you in full for the first year.</p>
